# Smart_waste_managment_system

Developed a web-based Smart Waste Management System to optimize waste collection and reduce inefficiency. The front-end was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for monitoring waste bin statuses in real time. MySQL was used for the back-end database to store information such as bin locations, fill levels, and waste types.

The system allows waste management teams to monitor bin statuses, track when bins are full, and make data-driven decisions to improve collection schedules. Server-side scripting was done using PHP to handle form submissions and communicate with the database for efficient data management.

The system also includes user authentication to restrict access to authorized personnel. By using real-time data monitoring, the project ensures timely waste collection, prevents bin overflow, and minimizes unnecessary collection trips. The application was deployed locally using XAMPP for development and testing, ensuring seamless interaction between the user interface and database.
